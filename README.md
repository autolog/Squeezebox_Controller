# Overview

The Autolog Squeezebox Controller is a plugin for version 6+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to control Squeezebox Servers and Players directly from Indigo.

There will be a new revised Indigo 7 version in due course.

It is **strongly recommended** to read the [Squeezebox Controller (V2.2.0) Information][2] documentation to familiarise yourself with the how the plugin works.
